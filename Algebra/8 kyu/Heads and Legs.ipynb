    "## Description\n",
    "Everybody has probably heard of the animal heads and legs problem from the earlier years at school. It goes:\n",
    "\n",
    "`“A farm contains chickens and cows. There are x heads and y legs. How many chickens and cows are there?”`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where x <= 1000 and y <=1000"

    "## Task\n",
    "Assuming there are no other types of animals, work out how many of each animal are there.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Return a tuple in Python - (chickens, cows) and an array list - [chickens, cows]/{chickens, cows} in all other languages`\n",
    "\n",
    "If either the heads & legs is negative, the result of your calculation is negative or the calculation is a float return \"No solutions\" (no valid cases), or [-1, -1] in COBOL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the form:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(Heads, Legs) = (72, 200)\n",
    "VALID - (72, 200) =>    (44, 28)\n",
    "                        (Chickens, Cows)\n",
    "INVALID - (72, 201) => \"No solutions\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `if 0 heads and 0 legs are given always return [0, 0]` since zero heads must give zero animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to solve this, but they all give the same answer.\n",

    "Being $h$ (total heads), $l$ (total legs), $c_h$ chicken and $c_o$ cow we can determine from the approach two equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of head of chickens and cows will be the total number of head:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_h+c_o=h$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, if we multiply these constants for each chicken and cow, we will have the total number of legs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(c_h*2)+(c_o*4)=l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are left with a system of equations with 2 equations and 2 unknowns, perfectly solvable:\n",

    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "\\textup c_h+c_o=h \\space (I)\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "(I) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_h=h-c_o$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(II) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Equating the equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h-c_o=\\frac{l}{2}-2*c_o$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearing $c_o$:\n",
    "\n",
